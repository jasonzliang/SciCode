## **Generating Code with LLMs**

### 1. Set Up Your API Keys

First, create a `keys.cfg` file at the root of the repository and add your API keys for the different providers as follows:

```
OPENAI_KEY = 'your_api_key'
ANTHROPIC_KEY = 'your_api_key'
GOOGLE_KEY = 'your_api_key' 
```

If you're using **litellm**, which supports a variety of providers including **vllm**, **Hugging Face**, and **Together AI**, make sure to include the relevant API key in the `keys.cfg` file. Please refer to the docs [here](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). Then, use `litellm/*` as the model name when running the command.

For example, to use **Together AI**'s models, you'll need to add the following to your `keys.cfg`:

```
TOGETHERAI_API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
```

### 2. Generating Code

To generate code using the **Together AI** model (e.g., `Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo`), go to the root of this repo and run:

```bash
python eval/scripts/gencode_json.py --model litellm/together_ai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo
```

To generate code using **GPT-4o** (with default settings), go to the root of this repo and run:

```bash
python eval/scripts/gencode_json.py --model gpt-4o
```

If you want to include **scientist-annotated background** in the prompts, use the `--with-background` flag:

```bash
python eval/scripts/gencode_json.py --model gpt-4o --with-background
```

Please note that we do not plan to release the ground truth code for each problem to the public. However, we have made a dev set available that includes the ground truth code in `eval/data/problems_dev.jsonl`. 

In this repository, **we only support evaluating with previously generated code for each step.**

### Command-Line Arguments

When running the `gencode_json.py` script, you can use the following options:

- `--model`: Specifies the model name to be used for generating code (e.g., `gpt-4o` or `litellm/together_ai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo`).
- `--output-dir`: Directory where the generated code outputs will be saved. Default is `eval_results/generated_code`.
- `--input-path`: Directory containing the JSON files describing the problems. Default is `eval/data/problems_all.jsonl`.
- `--prompt-dir`: Directory where prompt files are saved. Default is `eval_results/prompt`.
- `--with-background`: If enabled, includes the problem background in the generated code.
- `--temperature`: Controls the randomness of the output. Default is 0.

## **Evaluating the Generated Code**

### 1. Download Numeric Test Data

Download the [numeric test results](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W5GZW6_bdiDAiipuFMqdUhvUaHIj6-pR?usp=drive_link) and save it as `eval/data/test_data.h5`.

### 2. Run the Evaluation

To evaluate the generated code using a specific model, go to the root of this repo and use the following command:

```bash
python eval/scripts/test_generated_code.py --model "model_name"
```

Replace `"model_name"` with the appropriate model name, and include `--with-background` if the code is generated with **scientist-annotated background**.
